Infrared remote control and receiver

Coded using Keil uVision V5.34.0.0 using a TM4C123GXL from Texas Instruments. I have not used the libraries because I want to learn how to read and follow the TM4C datasheets.

I have used the IR remote, receiver and power supply from the Elegoo Super Starter kit. Refer to main.c for details.
